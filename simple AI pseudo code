Simple AI Pseudo Code

class AI:
	initialize function:
		1>/comment/inputs are up, down, left, right for car/comment/
		
		2>String left = "left", String right = "right", String down = "down", String up = "up"

		3>initialize dictionary of past directions and their scores, like so {down: [], left: [], right: [], up: []}
		Each array has to have a fixed length, deleting all old data. For example if the array length maximum was 5, an array of [1,2,3,4,5] would change to [2,3,4,5,6] if 6 was added. This is to simulate the learning process.
	end initialize function

	drive function:
		4>boolean high_score_fail = false
		5>loop:

		6>if no moves have been made yet try a random direction. Otherwise move in the direction with the highest score. Only using the most recent for each move. 

		7>If high_score_fail == true, look through all the move score data apart from the move that failed, and find the move with the highest score. set high_score_fail to false and then do the move! 

		8>get score for move and assign score to move dict array, example: {down: [3.4], left: [], right: [], up: []}

		9>if score is better than previous scores, repeat this move
		10>	if doing the same move again resulted in a lower score, high_score_fail = true
		11>if it's not better, high_score_fail = true

		12>end loop
	end drive function
